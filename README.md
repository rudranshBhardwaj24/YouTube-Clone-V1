# YouTube-Clone-V1
This YouTube clone is a web application built using React JS that closely mimics the features of the original YouTube application. With features such as search suggestions, debouncing, a functional sidebar, API polling for live chat, and nested comments, this application offers a seamless user experience that is similar to the original platform.

In addition to these features, my YouTube clone is well-optimized for performance, ensuring that users can enjoy a fast and responsive experience. I have also made an effort to maintain good code quality, making it easier for other developers to contribute to the project.

To use this application, simply follow the installation instructions provided in the README file. I welcome any contributions to the project and hope that you find my YouTube clone useful.

To get started with my YouTube clone, follow these steps after forking the repository:

Step 1: Go to https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application and obtain your API key.

Step 2: Inside src/utils/constants, remove import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_API; from the GOOGLE_AUTH_API variable and paste your API key there.

You are now ready to launch the application. Simply type npm run dev in your terminal to start the application. I welcome any contributions to the project and hope that you find my YouTube clone useful.
